# Multi-Agent-System


### Experimental Results:

We evaluated our multi-agent system composed of 3 agents + assistant taking the final decision. The experimental results in CVS contain:

  -  questions from the ARC Challenge Training,
  -  the agents prompts (with context, ARC question and instructions)
  -  generated answers by agents,
  -  agents selected options,
  -  the correct answers,
  -  the feedbacks to the agents
  -  the reflection prompts for the agents
  -  the reflections generated by the agents


Each agent is identified by their agent id in the CSV file.
